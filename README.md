# FastAPI Project Auto-Generator Library
# Project Vision
The FastAPI Project Auto-Generator Library is an upcoming tool designed to automate the creation of FastAPI-based project structures. This library aims to simplify the development process by transforming a database schema into a fully functional project foundation. It is tailored for developers who want a quick and efficient way to generate the backbone of their applications while retaining the flexibility to customize and implement business logic.

# Purpose
The main goal of this library is to eliminate the repetitive and time-consuming process of manually setting up projects. By generating essential components like database models, routing, and configurations, it allows developers to focus on building unique features and business logic. This tool is especially helpful for those looking to accelerate project delivery without compromising flexibility and scalability.

# How It Will Work
1. Input: Users will provide an SQL file that defines the structure of their database.
2. Output: The library will generate:
   - ORM models for database interaction.
   - Dependency injection models using Pydantic for streamlined validation.
   - Pre-configured routing files.
   - Complete project folder structure.
   - Optional setup for JWT authentication and an admin panel.
3. Customization:
   - Developers can adjust the generated files to fit specific requirements.
   - Business logic and custom features can be seamlessly integrated on top of the generated project.
4. Standard Functionality:
   - Basic CRUD operations for database tables.
   - Ready-to-use authentication and admin panel setup (if enabled).
